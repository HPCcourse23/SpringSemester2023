# Advanced High Performance Computing Exercise Sheet 10

## Exercise 1 [Test code]
Test code in `fft10.cxx`

## Exercise 2 [CUDA compilation]
1. Verify that code `fft10.cu` works the same

    It works the same as there is no action on device yet.

## Exercise 3 [Data transfer to the GPU]
Code in `exercise3/fft.cu`. Arrays `data3` and `data4` are the same.

## Exercise 4 [FFT on the GPU]
Code in `exercise4/fft.cu`

## Exercise 5 [Implement this in your code]
Code in `mass_assignments`
